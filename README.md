# UNCREATIVE PLATFORMER

## General Info
**This game was created as my semester project**.
At the moment, I'm dedicating the most time and effort to it.
I will return to work on other projects in June.
Currently, the game mechanics are being tested, and more ideas are being added.
**The project should be completed by mid-May**.

## Project Status
> Newest Version: **Public Presentation Type C**;
> Last Updated: **16-05-2024**;

## License
**Project licence is based on GPL 3.0**. It uses some 3rd part assets that I'll list bellow.
- **Orange Kid** - It's used as main font in this project. You can find it [here](https://www.1001fonts.com/orange-kid-font.html).
> There will also be transitional assets that I'll try to get rid of after each new build.

## Have a Good One!
