# UNCREATIVE PLATFORMER

## General Info
**This game was created as my semester project**.
I dedicated a lot of time to this game, thinking about creating a simple platformer with many interesting mechanics.
During the development of this project, I learned many things that, as we know, might come in handy later on.
For now, I need to take a break from programming; after some time, I will come back to handle minor fixes and then start working on other, personal projects.
**This project was completed on August 19th**.
